To run linter and check the code over tslint rules simply run `yarn lint` or `npm run lint`



#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. If you don't have `@angular/cli` as a global package on your system, you can run `npx ng generate component component-name`. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
